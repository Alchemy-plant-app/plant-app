    * Utilize chat window for interjections
* Not taking criticism personally -

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
* Open to criticism

### Conflict Resolution Plan

What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
* Make sure to hear from each person
* Resolve conflicts as a group
    * If everyone is open about how they feel, communicate freely, conflicts may be easier to resolve
* Immediacy of resolving conflict

* If you have an ambiguous thought, speak up about it - we can form the thought as a group
* Everyone's ideas are valid and important - don't think anything you have to say isn't important!
* Each of us are coming from unique experiences and backgrounds

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
* Pair programming as a solution to working through roadblocks
* No finger-pointing
* Being gentle - soft addressing team members to get input they may be wanting to offer rather than pressing them to contribute even when they may not know how to offer
* Ask for help when you're stuck
    * Reach out to TAs / Julie after ~30 minutes of working through a roadblock
* Delegation of tasks - self-selecting is good! Being tasked by a "group authority" sucks.
    * Knowing your role - what skill are you interested in building?

What is your process to resolve conflicts?
* Address group conflicts within the group setting

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

ON DEBUGGING:
* Team agreement to mob debug first, then breakout to smaller rooms if the issue persists

Q:
how do we feel about doing a lot of pair programming
or are we tryna individually do everything and merge

why donâ€™t we all agree that its our job to make our opinions and stances known to the group, and as a group we can choose how to move forward with everything on the table
